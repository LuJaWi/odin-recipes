    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups red and/or yellow lentils</li>
        <li>4–6 serrano chiles, depending on heat preference, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3” piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons curry powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 28 ounce can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, optional</li>
        <li>14 ounces heavy cream or unsweetened coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>Freshly squeezed lemon juice, to serve</li>
        <li>Basmati rice, to serve</li>
        <li>Naan, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, soak the lentils for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse well, 
            and then transfer the lentils to the bowl of the slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Combine the serrano chiles, chopped onion, garlic, ginger, curry powder, cumin,
         turmeric, chili powder, and sugar in a food processor. Process until the mixture 
         becomes a paste and is well-combined. Transfer the mixture to the slow cooker. 
         Stir in 6 cups of water and the diced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cover the slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours, or until the 
        lentils are soft. Season very generously with salt, stir well, and adjust remaining 
        seasonings, to taste. Gently mash about half of the lentils with a mixing spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in the butter, if desired, and the heavy cream or coconut milk, a bit at a 
            time, until reaching the desired richness and consistency. Mix in the cilantro, 
            saving some to top.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with freshly squeezed lemon, basmati rice, and naan.</li>
    </ol>
